STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO DEPLOY YOUR SUPABASE EDGE FUNCTION

1. FIND YOUR SUPABASE PROJECT ID:
   a. Go to https://app.supabase.com/
   b. Sign in to your account
   c. Select your project from the dashboard
   d. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar
   e. The URL will look like: https://app.supabase.com/project/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
   f. Your Project ID is the random string after "/project/" (e.g., "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")

2. NAVIGATE TO YOUR PROJECT DIRECTORY:
   Open Terminal and run:
   cd /Users/sittminthar/Downloads/project

3. DEPLOY THE FUNCTION:
   In Terminal, run:
   supabase functions deploy chat-with-openai --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   
   Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with the actual ID you found in step 1.f

4. VERIFY THE FUNCTION IS DEPLOYED:
   a. Go back to the Supabase Dashboard
   b. In the left sidebar, click on "Functions"
   c. You should see "chat-with-openai" in the list of functions

5. TEST THE FUNCTION:
   Run the test script:
   node test-function-locally.js

   Or use curl:
   curl -X POST \
     https://YOUR_SUPABASE_URL.supabase.co/functions/v1/chat-with-openai \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message":"Hello! မင်္ဂလာပါ။ သင်ဘယ်လိုအကူအညီပေးနိုင်ပါသလဲ?"}'

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you get permission errors, make sure you're logged in to the Supabase CLI:
  supabase login
  
- If the function doesn't appear in the dashboard, check that the deployment succeeded

- If you get "Function not found" errors, make sure you used the correct project ID
